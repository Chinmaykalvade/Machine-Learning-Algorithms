        "    \"At a time when Congress and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have locked horns over the multi-billion Rafale aircraft deal between India and France, a French journalist/ blogger has posted a document, reportedly, minutes of a meeting held on May 11, 2017, in which Loik Segalenn, one of the top officials of Dassault said that a contract with Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence was 'obligatory' if Dassault wanted to win the Rafale deal. A quick translation of the said text in the document reads- \\\"A complete presentation of the Make in India creation of the firm Dassault Reliance Aerospace Nagpur has been done. According to Mr Segalenn, it was imperative and obligatory for Dassault-Aviation to accept this counterpart in order to obtain the Rafale India export contract.\\\"\",\n",
        "    \"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today received the first of the 36 long-awaited Rafale fighter jets on behalf of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Speaking at the event, Defence Minister termed the developments as \\\"historic\\\" and said that it will go a long way in strengthening strategic-ties between India and France. This is a new milestone in bilateral ties, said Rajnath Singh. India had signed an agreement with France for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of Rs. 59,000 crore in September 2016. The first batch of four jets will come next May. Commenting on the positives of this- receiving Rafale from France, Singh said it will enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and lay a global blueprint for successful defence cooperation between two responsible states. He also thanked the French state for providing support and training to Indian Air force pilots.\",\n",
        "    \"Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday received India’s first Rafale jet in an official handover ceremony in Merignac, a suburb of the south-western French city of Bordeaux. The raksha mantri and his ministry also made an event of it as the ceremony coincides with the day the Dusshera festival is celebrated in India: after conducting a traditional ‘Shastra Puja’, Singh will take a sortie in a two-seater trainer version of the aircraft. Over the last year, the 7.8 billion euro deal became a source of controversy for the Narendra Modi government, with questions being raised on the process and procedure that was followed.\",\n",
        "    \"India got the formal delivery of the first of the 36 long-awaited Rafale fighter jets bought from the Dassault Aviation in France on Tuesday. Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who is on a three-day visit to France, accepted the handover at a facility of Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation in Bordeaux. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was preceded by Shastra Puja - the traditional worship of weapons during Dussehra. The minister also went for a sortie in the aircraft -- a process that was also meant to test the India-specific adaptations made. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Singh met French President Emmanuel Macron and discussed stronger strategic ties with France.\",\n",
        "    \"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh flying to France to oversee handing over of the first Rafale fighter jet on 8 October to the Indian Air Force has special significance. Initial reports suggested that the fighter jet was to be handed over to India on 19 September, but then top defence ministry sources suggested that it was postponed due to logistical reasons. It seems that the political leadership in the government put some thought to decide on 8 October as the date of handing over of the first of the next generation aircraft. An elaborate ceremony in France on that day will coincide with two special occasions in India: celebration of Air Force Day and Vijayadashmi on the conclusion of 10-day Dussehra festival.\",\n",
        "    \"There’s a bizarre connection between the two French-made frontline fighters in the Indian Air Force inventory—the Mirage 2000 and now the first Rafale multi-role fighter handed over to Rajnath Singh in Bordeaux. Here’s the irony. Despite Rahul Gandhi’s fierce attacks on the Rafale deal, the fact remains that his grandmother did exactly the same thing with regard to the Mirage 2000. In 1984, Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister ordered 40 Mirage 2000 jets from France. Like the Rafale, the original offer from the French side was to transfer technology to HAL and set up a production line in India. It was a clear case of déjà vue.\",\n",
        "    \"Pakistan should be worried about India acquiring Rafale fighter jets, not the Congress, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said here on Wednesday. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh took symbolic delivery of the first Rafale aircraft in France on Tuesday. \\\"The Congress could not get Rafale jets for the country for one decade. They tried to put hurdles in its path when they were in opposition,\\\" Hussain alleged, speaking to reporters here. \\\"If India is getting advanced aircraft like Rafale, Pakistan should be worried, why Congress is so worried,\\\" he quipped.\",\n",
        "    \"France has delivered to India its first Rafale fighter jet from a series of 36 aircraft purchased in a multi-billion dollar deal in 2016. Defense Minister Florence Parly and her Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh, who is on a three-day visit to France, attended a ceremony Tuesday at aircraft maker Dassault Aviation facility in Merignac, southwestern France. The ministers also are scheduled to hold talks on defense cooperation and security issues in the Indo-Pacific region. The $8.78 billion deal sparked controversy in India last year with the main opposition Indian National Congress party accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government of buying the aircraft at nearly three times the price being negotiated when it was the ruling party before Modi came to power in 2014. The government denied any wrongdoing.\",\n",
        "    \"Rafale jets will greatly enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and will give the IAF an edge over Pakistan and China, new IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Monday. \\\"Rafale is a very capable aircraft, once we induct it, it will be a gamechanger in terms of our operational capability and when we use it in combination with SU-30 and other fleets which we have, we would have a serious jump in our capability. It will give us an edge over Pakistan and China,\\\" Bhadauria told ANI soon after taking over as the 26th chief of the force. Incidentally, Bhadauria was the chairman of the Indian negotiation team for the ₹60,000 crore 36 Rafale combat aircraft deal and played a significant role in getting deal cleared. The Rafale deal signed in 2016 is the biggest ever defence deal signed by India.\",\n",
        "    \"Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday said he was happy that Rafale jets will finally come to India but he still wanted to know why just 36 instead of 126 were being bought by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government. He also said that the party will continue to raise questions about the deal including the price of the fighter jet. \\\"We are happy that Rafale aircraft will finally begin arriving. When the country needed 126 jets, Modiji reduced the number to just 36. Neither I know nor the country knows the reason behind it. However, it is great that the jets will begin arriving soon,\\\" Mr Singh said.\"\n",
